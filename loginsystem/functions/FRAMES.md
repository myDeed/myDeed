# mydeed-frames.html

## Overview

This HTML file serves as the main frameset for the myDeed application, defining its basic layout using frames:

- **navbar.html:** A top frame containing the navigation bar (80 pixels tall).
- **mainContent:** A larger, scrollable frame for displaying the main content.

## Structure

- **frameset:** Divides the browser window into two frames using `rows="80,*"`.
- **frame src="navbar.html":** Loads the navigation bar into the top frame.
- **frame src="about:blank" name="mainContent":** Creates an initially blank frame for the main content.
- **styles.css:** Applies styling to the frames (not included here).
- **noframes:** Provides a fallback message for browsers that don't support frames.

## Considerations

- **Frames:** Frames have limited support in modern web development due to accessibility, SEO, and usability concerns. Consider using more modern layout techniques like CSS Grid or Flexbox.
- **Dynamic Content:** The `mainContent` frame is initially blank. It's likely intended to be populated dynamically using JavaScript or server-side rendering.
- **Navigation:** The `navbar.html` frame likely contains links or buttons to control the content displayed in `mainContent`.
- **Styling:** The `styles.css` file is important for visual presentation but not included here.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure proper accessibility practices for users with screen readers or those who rely on keyboard navigation.
