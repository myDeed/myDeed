# mydeed-home(mydeed.html)

## Overview

This HTML file serves as the home page for the myDeed application, providing basic instructions and a placeholder for dynamically loaded content.

## Structure

- **Head:** Includes meta tags, title, and links to stylesheets.
- **Body:**
    - **Styling:** Black background with white text for primary content.
    - **Dynamic Content Container:** An empty `div` with `id="dynamic-content"` to hold content loaded via JavaScript.
    - **Wallet Information:** A `p` element with `id="wallet-info"` displays the user's connection status to web3.
    - **Initial Instructions:** Basic instructions are displayed before dynamic content is loaded.

## JavaScript Interactions

- **loadNavbar():** Fetches `navbar.html` and injects it into the page (functionality currently commented out).
- **DOMContentLoaded:**
    - Calls `loadNavbar()` to potentially load the navigation bar.
    - Checks for a connected wallet in localStorage and updates the `wallet-info` element if found.

## Additional Information

- **Dynamic Content:** The application likely uses JavaScript to load different content into the `dynamic-content` div based on user interactions.
- **Connected Wallet Display:** The application stores the connected wallet address in localStorage and displays it on the home page.
- **Navigation:** The intended navigation system (potentially involving the commented-out navbar) is not fully implemented in this file.
- **styles.css:** The external stylesheet is not included here but is important for visual presentation.

## Considerations

- **Placeholder Content:** The initial instructions will be replaced with dynamic content.
- **Navigation Implementation:** Complete the navigation implementation for a functional user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure proper accessibility practices, especially for dynamic content updates.
