# Login.php

## Code Breakdown

```php
if request_method == "POST":
    include_db_connect()  # Include the database connection script

    username = post_data["username"]
    password = post_data["password"]

    # Formulate SQL query to fetch user details based on the username
    sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username'"
    query_result = execute_query(sql_query)  # Execute the SQL query

    num_rows = count_rows(query_result)  # Count the number of rows returned

    if num_rows == 1:
        # Loop through the rows (usually just one row) obtained from the query
        while row = fetch_row(query_result):
            # Verify the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database
            if verify_password(password, row['password']):
                login = true  # Set login flag to true

                # Set session variables for the logged-in user
                set_session_variables(username)

                redirect_to_main_page()  # Redirect the user to the main page
                exit_script()  # Exit the script after redirection
            else:
                show_error_message("Invalid Credentials")  # Show error for incorrect password
    else:
        show_error_message("Invalid Credentials")  # Show error for incorrect username


## Additional Notes

- The code relies on functions like `include_db_connect`, `execute_query`, `count_rows`, `fetch_row`, `verify_password`, `set_session_variables`, `redirect_to_main_page`, and `exit_script`. Their implementations are not provided in this code snippet.
- Consider potential vulnerabilities with SQL injection and password storage.

# Frames.html

## Code Breakdown

html
(Start)
Load mainFrame HTML page

If browser supports frames
    Load 'navbar.html' in the top frame with a black background
    Load a blank page in the main content frame with a black background
Else
    Display a message to update the browser for frame support


## Considerations

- Frames are generally discouraged in modern web development due to accessibility and usability concerns.
- Consider using alternative approaches like server-side includes or client-side routing.
