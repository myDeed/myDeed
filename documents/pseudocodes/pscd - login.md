# login.php

## Overview

This PHP script establishes a connection to a database to facilitate user login functionality.

## Structure

1. **Server Details:**
    - Defines variables for server name, username, password, and database name.
2. **Connection Attempt:**
    - Calls the `connect_to_database` function to initiate connection.
3. **Connection Check:**
    - If successful, displays a success message.
    - If unsuccessful, displays an error message.
4. **connect_to_database Function:**
    - Accepts server, username, password, and database details as arguments.
    - Uses a `try...except` block to handle potential connection errors.
    - Attempts to establish a connection using `establish_connection` (assumed to be a built-in or custom function).
    - Returns the connection object if successful, otherwise returns null.

## Considerations

- **Security:**
    - Store sensitive credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
    - Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Provide informative error messages to aid troubleshooting.
    - Log errors for monitoring and analysis.
- **Database Interaction:**
    - This script only establishes a connection. Additional logic for user authentication and data retrieval is likely required.
- **Dependency:**
    - Relies on the `establish_connection` function (implementation not provided).
